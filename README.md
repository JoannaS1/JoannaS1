## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm a data analyst with an interest in machine learning!

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio, where I showcase my data science projects. As a data analyst, I have experience in data manipulation and analysis using SQL. Recently, I completed a bootcamp on data science where I learned the basics of machine learning using Python's popular machine learning library scikit-learn. I also learned Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and numpy.

During the bootcamp, I focused on supervised learning models such as regression and decision trees, as well as unsupervised learning methods such as clustering and PCA. I am eager to continue expanding my knowledge of machine learning and other data science topics.

On this GitHub repository, I will be sharing my completed and upcoming projects in the field of data science. Currently, I am in the process of adding the capstone projects from my bootcamp, which allowed me to apply my newly learned machine learning skills to real-world data.

Feel free to browse my GitHub profile to learn more about my experience and interests in data science. If you have any questions or would like to connect with me, please don't hesitate to reach out. I look forward to hearing from you!
